# Chapter 1 - Understanding the Purpose of Presentations

The art of presenting is an indispensable skill in professional and personal settings alike. Presentations allow us to showcase our ideas, beliefs, and data to a receptive audience. But how do you ensure that your presentation is not only effective but also memorable for your audience?

The answer lies in understanding the purpose of your presentation. In this chapter, we delve into what makes a presentation exceptional by examining its purpose and how to identify it. 

And who better to speak to us about the importance of understanding the purpose of a presentation than Simon Sinek? Sinek is a renowned author and motivational speaker, known for his TED Talks on leadership and management.

According to Sinek, any successful presentation begins with the question of "why". Why are you presenting? What message do you want to convey? Understanding the purpose of your presentation in terms of the outcome you are trying to achieve is the first step to crafting your message and plotting your presentation.

One sure way to identify the purpose of your presentation is by using the "5 W's". By asking who, what, when, where, and why, you can effectively identify your purpose. It will help define the scope and objective of your presentation and allow you to tailor your message to your audience's needs.

**Code Sample**
```python
def identify_purpose(presentation):
    """
    This function takes in a presentation and identifies its purpose using the '5 W's'
    """
    who = presentation['audience']
    what = presentation['topic']
    when = presentation['date']
    where = presentation['venue']
    why = presentation['objective']
    
    purpose = f"The purpose of this presentation is to inform {who} about {what}, on {when} at {where} to achieve {why}."
    
    return purpose
```
 
By understanding the purpose of your presentation, you can create a framework that sets the tone for the entire presentation. With that, let's move onto the next chapter, where we'll learn how to structure our presentations to ensure maximum success.
# Chapter 1 - Understanding the Purpose of Presentations


The Greek goddess Athena is considered the patron of knowledge, wisdom, and inspiration. She inspired many humans to develop the art of rhetoric, a crucial skill in sharing knowledge. In modern times, inspiring figures like Simon Sinek carry on Athena's legacy by promoting effective communication and public speaking.

One day, a young orator named Alexios traveled to the top of Mount Olympus to seek Athena's guidance on crafting an exceptional presentation. Alexios had a wealth of knowledge to share but struggled with organizing his ideas and connecting with his audience.

Athena, in her infinite wisdom, advised Alexios to start with a clear understanding of his presentation's purpose. She encouraged him to identify the message he wished to convey and the specific outcome he wanted to achieve. This, she told him, was the foundation on which he would structure his entire presentation.

Alexios left Mount Olympus feeling invigorated but still unsure of how to identify his presentation's purpose. He decided to seek other renowned speakers' advice in the realm of public speaking. Enter Simon Sinek, the great orator of the world.

Simon Sinek, a wise and renowned speaker, understood the value of beginning with "why." "Why" helps to distill a message down to its very essence, extracting themes that anchor the message. He advised Alexios to define the presentation with the following five questions â€“ "who," "what," "when," "where," and "why." By answering these questions, Alexios would be able to clearly identify the purpose of his presentation.

Alexios heeded Sinek's advice and used the 5 W's to identify the purpose of his presentation. With this newfound knowledge, he continued his journey with renewed energy and purpose, eager to apply this principle to his presentations, and deliver impactful and memorable presentations.

The lesson passed down by the great orator in the realm of public speaking is, starting with the purpose is the key to crafting exceptional presentations. By defining your presentation's purpose, your message takes on life and form, making your presentation more structured and relatable to your audience.
The code sample used in this chapter demonstrates how one can use the "5 W's" framework to identify the purpose of a presentation. 

The `identify_purpose` function takes in a dictionary of the presentation's details, including the audience, topic, date, venue and objective (the 5 W's). 

Using string formatting, the function extracts the relevant details and merges them into a statement that clearly states the purpose of the presentation. 

This function's purpose is to assist presenters in structuring their presentations by providing clarity on why they are presenting in the first place. By knowing the objective of their presentation, presenters can optimize their content to ensure that it aligns with their audience's needs, driving home a strong and memorable message.

By starting with 'why,' the 'how' and 'what' will follow more easily, and the presentation will come across a more engaging and focused to the audience.
