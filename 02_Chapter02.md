# Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Type of Presentation

Welcome back, dear reader! In the previous chapter, we learned about understanding the purpose of presentations. We dwelled on the fact that the purpose of any presentation is to convey your message effectively to the audience. It was indeed a crucial chapter, as understanding the purpose lays the foundation for creating a successful presentation. 

Now, as we move forward into the world of creating presentations, let us delve deep into the art of choosing the right type of presentation for your audience and purpose. As a presenter, it is essential to choose a presentation type that best suits your context, content, and audience. 

There are different ways to categorize types of presentation. Still, for the sake of simplicity, let us divide them into three broad categories - informative, persuasive, and entertaining. Each presentation type has a specific objective and purpose. The type of presentation you choose sets the tone and expectation of your audience and directly impacts their engagement level and experience.

In the upcoming sections, we will explore each of these presentation types in-depth. We will discuss various scenarios where each of these types is used and provide practical tips to choose and craft your presentation effectively.

So, dear reader, are you ready to learn the art of choosing the right type of presentation? Let's dive into this exciting journey!
# Chapter 2: Choosing the Right Type of Presentation 

## The Quest for the Right Type of Presentation

In the land of the presenters, the great King Polydeuces was known for his exceptional presentations, which he delivered with passion and zeal. King Polydeuces had many followers, but among them was a young and ambitious presenter named Ophion who wanted to learn from the great King Polydeuces.

One sunny day, King Polydeuces summoned Ophion and asked him to undertake a quest to find the right type of presentation. Ophion was thrilled at this opportunity, and he accepted the challenge without any hesitation.

King Polydeuces warned Ophion that the quest would not be an easy one. He informed Ophion that he would face many obstacles and challenges on his journey, and he would have to overcome them to find the right type of presentation. 

With a determined heart, Ophion set forth on his journey, not knowing what awaited him. As he walked, he encountered many creatures, each of whom posed a different challenge.

## The Sphinx's Challenge

The first challenge came in the form of the Sphinx, who asked, "What is the purpose of your presentation?" 

Ophion remembered what he had learned in his previous quest - the understanding of the purpose of presentations. He replied confidently, "To convey my message effectively to the audience." 

The Sphinx was impressed and allowed Ophion to pass. 

## The Three-Headed Hydra's Challenge

As Ophion was walking, he came across the Three-Headed Hydra. The Hydra asked, "What type of presentation will you choose?"

Ophion remembered King Polydeuces' teachings and replied, "There are different types of presentations, but I will choose the one that best suits my context, content, and audience."

The Hydra was pleased and allowed Ophion to pass.

## The Siren's Challenge

As Ophion approached the sea, he heard a beautiful song. It was the Siren who sang, "Choose an informative, persuasive, or entertaining presentation type and make it engaging and memorable."

Ophion remembered what he had learned and decided to choose an entertaining presentation type. He crafted his presentation beautifully, added some humor, and used some impressive visuals and animations.

The Siren was pleased and granted Ophion permission to continue his quest.

## The Medusa's Challenge

As Ophion continued his journey, he encountered the fearsome Medusa, who asked, "How will you make your presentation exceptional?"

Ophion remembered the principles of creating exceptional presentations, which he learned from King Polydeuces. He replied, "I will prepare, practice, and deliver my presentation with passion and confidence. I will also engage my audience and make sure that they have a memorable experience."

The Medusa was impressed and allowed Ophion to pass.

## The Reward

Finally, after overcoming many challenges, Ophion found the right type of presentation that suited his context, content, and audience. He returned to King Polydeuces and presented his exceptional work.

King Polydeuces was delighted with Ophion's presentation and declared him a great presenter. He gifted Ophion with the power to create exceptional presentations and to inspire others to do the same.
