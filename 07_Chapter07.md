# Chapter 7: Engaging your audience through interactive elements

Welcome to the seventh chapter of our journey in creating the most exceptional presentations! In the previous chapter, we discussed how using storytelling techniques can help you capture the attention of your audience. 

Now, we will explore another effective way to engage your audience- through interactive elements. These elements will make your presentation more memorable and keep your audience interested throughout the entire presentation.

Interactive elements such as quizzes, surveys, and polls can be used to initiate a conversation with your audience, create an interactive learning experience and gather valuable feedback. They also make your presentations more entertaining and dynamic, and you can involve your audience in the conversation.

To create interactive elements, you can use several tools and software such as Microsoft Forms, Google Forms, and Mentimeter. These tools can be used to create interactive surveys, quizzes, or polls that you can embed in your presentation.

Moreover, you can use HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create interactive features within your presentation slides. Adding animations, hover effects, and clickable buttons can make your presentations more engaging and interactive.

But remember, overuse of interactive elements can have a negative impact on your presentation. Make sure you use interactive elements that are relevant to your content and are in line with your presentation objectives.

In the following sections of this chapter, we will dive deep into the various interactive elements that you can add to your presentations, the best practices to use these elements, how to create them, and how to implement them using code.

So, let's gear up and start exploring!
# Chapter 7: Engaging your audience through interactive elements
 
## The Quest for Interactivity
 
### The Oracle of Apollo
 
Once upon a time in Ancient Greece, a great warrior named Demetrius was summoned by the Oracle of Apollo. He approached the mystical Oracle with a single question - "How can I make my presentations more engaging and memorable?"

The Oracle of Apollo smiled and answered, "Brave warrior, you must implement interactive elements into your presentations. These elements will allow your audience to participate in your presentation, resulting in a truly unforgettable experience."

Demetrius was confused and asked for clarification, and the Oracle explained that interactive elements such as quizzes, surveys, and polls would make the audience an active participant. Such interaction helps to keep their attention and interest throughout the presentation. 

To achieve this, Demetrius decided to embark on a quest entrusted by the Oracle of Apollo to find the ultimate tool that would help him create interactive presentations. 

### Charybdis, the Monstrous Demoness
 
Demetrius' quest was not a straightforward one. He faced challenges and dangerous obstacles on his journey. One such task was to defeat Charybdis, the monstrous demoness who was known for engulfing everything that came in her path, creating chaos and confusion.

For Demetrius, Charybdis's chaotic nature represented the state of presentations that failed to keep the audience engaged. To defeat her, he had to find a way to bring order to the confusion. Luckily, he found a powerful tool that would help him do just that - Microsoft Forms.

 Microsoft Forms is a user-friendly and free tool that helps create interactive surveys, quizzes, and polls. The tool helped Demetrius bring order to the chaos, and he triumphed over Charybdis, saving many presentations from her destructive path.

 The warrior continued on his journey, and the next challenge he faced was even more daunting.

### The Sphinx, the Riddle Master
 
It was said that the Sphinx, the Riddle Master, had a riddle so complex that nobody had ever been able to solve it. Demetrius arrived at the lair of the Sphinx, ready to unravel the mystery.

However, the Sphinx had a quizzical notion of a presentation, where interactive elements only serve as an add-on and were not essential. Demetrius knew he had to do more than solve the puzzle to convince the Sphinx, and he did just that by proving to her what an ideal presentation looked like, complete with conductive interactive elements.

To achieve this, he used Google Forms, another free tool that was incredibly user-friendly, to create interactive surveys, quizzes, and polls. He showed the Sphinx how using such interactive features increases audience participation, encouraging them to be more involved and take action. The Sphinx was impressed with Demetrius' answer to her riddle and the usefulness of interactive elements.

### The Cyclops, the Mighty Blacksmith
 
The final obstacle standing in Demetrius' way was the mighty Cyclops, the blacksmith. The Cyclops was not averse to interpersonal connections, and he only respected interactively designed presentations that had relevant interactive elements.

To demonstrate this, Demetrius took out his Javascript, HTML, and CSS swords to show the Cyclops how he could use code to develop clickable features, animations, and hover effects to make the presentation more interactive.

The Cyclops was delighted and even crafted a wondrous tool called Mentimeter, which helps create interactive presentations that enable the desires and interests of the audience to be fulfilled.

With the use of these potent, interactive tools, Demetrius created presentations that were not only entertaining, but also memorable. His interactive presentations made the audience an active participant, helping to convey his message more effectively.

### The End of the Quest
 
And thus, Demetrius completed his quest with flying colors and gained the knowledge needed to create interactive and exceptional presentations for everyone to enjoy and remember. 

The Oracle of Apollo blessed him with a tool belt of interactivity that would help him create engaging presentations for all eternity!
## Code to Implement Interactive Elements

Demetrius used a variety of tools and software to create interactive elements in his presentations. Here's an overview of the various coding languages he used, along with code samples that you can use in your own presentations:

### 1. Microsoft Forms

Microsoft Forms is a free tool that helps create interactive surveys, quizzes, and polls. Here's how to embed a Microsoft Form into your presentation using HTML:

```html
<iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://forms.office.com/PAGES_TO_EMBED"></iframe>
```

Replace "PAGES_TO_EMBED" with the URL of the Microsoft Form you want to embed.

### 2. Google Forms

Google Forms is another free tool that helps create interactive surveys, quizzes, and polls. Here's how to embed a Google Form into your presentation using HTML:

```html
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/FORMS_TO_EMBED/viewform?embedded=true" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0">Loadingâ€¦</iframe>
```

Replace "FORMS_TO_EMBED" with the URL of the Google Form you want to embed.

### 3. Javascript, HTML, and CSS

Demetrius used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create various interactive features such as clickable buttons, animations, and hover effects. Here's an example of how to create a button using HTML and CSS:

```html
<button class="interactive-button">Click me!</button>

<style>
.interactive-button {
    background-color: #4CAF50; /* Green */
    border: none;
    color: white;
    padding: 15px 32px;
    text-align: center;
    text-decoration: none;
    display: inline-block;
    font-size: 16px;
    margin: 4px 2px;
    cursor: pointer;
    border-radius: 10px;
}

.interactive-button:hover {
    background-color: #3e8e41;
}
</style>
```

Using CSS, you can style the button to your liking, adding a hover effect and other details, changing the shape, size, also adding CSS animations to make them look appealing.

### 4. Mentimeter

Mentimeter is a powerful tool that helps create interactive presentations with features that allow for audience participation. Here's an example of how to create a poll using Mentimeter:

```html
<iframe src="https://www.menti.com/XXXXXXXX" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

Replace "XXXXXXXX" in the URL with your unique Mentimeter presentation ID.

These are just a few examples of how to implement interactive elements in your presentations. Be sure to explore and experiment with these tools and coding languages to create unique interactive features that make your presentations unforgettable. Happy coding!
